ScalaTest 2.0 is a major upgrade to ScalaTest, the culmination of over two years of effort. Although it includes
many enhancements, we kept a close eye on compatibility with existing ScalaTest 1.x code. We also tried hard
to preserve what people liked about ScalaTest 1.x: that it is simple, the code is clean and clear, it's fully
documented, and because of very thorough testing, it "just works."
